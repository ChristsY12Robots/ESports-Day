Tetris, Space Invaders and Pacman all have quit at any time functionality, where the user can press 'esc' to quit at any point in their
playthrough. Maybe this should be standard and specificed in the home menu?

Both Tetris and Pacman use '27save' to save to a file on the game side, where the main menu will pick up using '35recieve' to pick up 
where each game leaves off.
