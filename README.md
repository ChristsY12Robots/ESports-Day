# ESports-Day
#A Christ's School ESports Day project

This project was started in November of 2017, and built for the 23rd of Feb 2018. It is a main menu which holds links to Tetris, Pacman, Snake and Space Invaders games. The scores from these are then sent to a local database. The final version folder holds all games and 'final versions' of every program, to run esports day, run esports.exe within the final version folder.
