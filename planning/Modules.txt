possible modules:

	Objects.py - robots/player classes.

	Rendering.py - Handles rendering.

	Main.py/Robots.py - This could be many things in my opinion.

	Backround_Sys.py - this will handle data: scores , house teams , game save files, results.

	Error.py- all errors handling goes to this module. maybe? this might not be needed.
